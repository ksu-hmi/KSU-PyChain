# KSU-PyChain
A simple Blockchain made with Python.
Our goal is to create a simple method that allows anyone to share information / thought about it. It is timeless and irreversible since the data will be stored on the blockchain. 
The data could literally be anything. It can even be files, doesn't matter The data is stored in the form of blocks that are chained together using hashes. This is the name "block-chain."
